## About the Game

**ISLA** is a story-driven psychological adventure that blurs the line between *memory and imagination*.

You play as **Don**, a man haunted by the echoes of his forgotten past.  
Inside a decaying world shaped from fractured memories, he searches for **Isla** — the girl who once gave life to his imagination.

As Don ventures deeper into this world, the boundary between fiction and reality dissolves.  
Isla’s stories are no longer mere tales... they are the reflection of Don’s buried guilt — and the truth waiting to resurface.

> Every step forward is a descent into the self.  
> Every memory is a mirror.  
> Every reflection hides something that should never have been seen.
